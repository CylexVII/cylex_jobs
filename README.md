F.A.Q
Why I should use cylex_jobs instead of esx_jobs or any other resources?: Well, it’s simple. You can add/remove jobs without any struggle. Everything is in config. It’s optimized.

MS Statistics: 0.01 when you are not doing the job and 0.08 when you are doing the job.

Is it realistic?: Yes. I tried to make it as realistic as possible for you, and your player’s enjoyment. There is animations, progressbar etc (You can set the texts .

I created a job as “slaughterer” to give an example for how jobs work. You can copy and paste then BOOM!
